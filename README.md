Hierarchical RNN for Document Summarization

This project is my attempt to replicate this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.07252.pdf. 
The project contains notebooks of my implementation for sentence extractor and word extractor in Tensorflow.
The codes are poorly organized and there are supporting python source files that are not available.
My implementation for non-object oriented style bucketing for variable length RNN input might be useful to follow.
I also did the implementation of encoder-decoder architecture that follow the paper description.
